## Running the project

First, check if you are running the version >= 16 of `node`. I recommend the use of [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and switch between the node versions.

## Install the dependencies

The first step after checking the node version is to install the project dependencies. For it run

### `yarn install`
## Run the app
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## To build a production version
### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
